# Controlling Wheelchair Using Eye Movement

## Introduction
This project is for controlling a wheelchair using eye movement. The project was GSU IoT Master's Degree course's final project. The project is implemented using Python and Torch model. The project is divided into two parts:
1. Training the model
2. Controlling the wheelchair

## Requirements
1. Python 3.11
2. Torch
3. Webcam
4. Raspberry Pi 4

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.11
2. Install Torch
3. Install the required libraries

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `v4.py` file to train the model
3. Run the `raspberry_main.py` file to control the wheelchair

## Training the model
The model is trained using the data collected from the webcam. The data is collected using the webcam and the eye movement is detected using the Haar Cascade Classifier. The data is then used to train the model. The model is trained using the Torch library.

## Controlling the wheelchair
The wheelchair is controlled using the eye movement. The eye movement is detected using the webcam and the Haar Cascade Classifier. The detected eye movement is then used to control the wheelchair.

## Conclusion
The project is successfully implemented and the wheelchair is controlled using the eye movement. The project is implemented using Python and Torch model. Utilized with Raspberry Pi 4.
